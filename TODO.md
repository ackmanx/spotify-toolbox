# Bug

next-dev.js?3515:32 Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `61KJdJU38zrAW4c3PI9C9N`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
